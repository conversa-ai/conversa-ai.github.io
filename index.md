## Project Information

- **Principal Investigators:** David Griol Barres, Zoraida Callejas Carrión
- **Project Title:** Effective and efficient resources and models for transformative conversational AI in Spanish and co-official languages (CONVERSA)

## Objectives

CONVERSA aims to democratize access to conversational AI through efficient and innovative resource development in Spanish, Catalan, Euskera, and Galician.

### General Objective

- Democratize conversational AI with efficient computational and data-driven methods, producing open and safe resources.

### Specific Objectives

1. **Corpus Creation:** Annotate open-access multilingual dialogue corpora.
2. **Model Development:** Generate efficient neural architectures for conversational AI.
3. **Tool Development:** Create open-source corpus, bias detection, and privacy analysis tools.
4. **Evaluation:** Ensure rigorous evaluation with replicability, bias avoidance, and privacy preservation.
5. **Demonstrator:** Develop conversational AI e-government services for isolated/rural communities.

## Project Justification

Conversational AI enhances digital transformation by improving access, personalization, usability, and transparency in digital services. However, the Spanish language and its co-official counterparts currently face significant barriers due to limited resources and computational costs. CONVERSA addresses these issues by:

- Generating high-quality multilingual training data.
- Creating efficient, data-driven conversational AI models.
- Ensuring transparency, security, and explainability of AI systems.

## Main Achievements

### 1. Multilingual Dialogue Corpus

- Collection and annotation of multilingual conversational data, supporting high-quality training material for conversational AI.

### 2. Bias Annotation & Detection

- Tools and methodologies to detect and mitigate biases in conversational AI datasets and models.

### 3. Dialogue System Demonstrators

- Creation of innovative, deployable conversational systems for e-government services, facilitating digital access in isolated regions.
